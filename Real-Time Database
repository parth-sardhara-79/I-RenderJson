In order to use AngularFire in your project, you need to include the following files in your index.html:-

  <!-- angularjs library -->
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
  <!-- firebase library -->
  <script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.2.4/firebase.js"></script>
  <!-- firebase library for angular js -->
  <script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/libs/angularfire/1.1.2/angularfire.min.js"></script>


Injected firebase into firebaseService.js:-
      I.E.:- var app = angular.module('firebaseModule', ['firebase']);

Then created a firebase reference to connect with firebase DB which generate the reference URL:-
  =>  Used the reference URL at getFirebaseObj method into firebaseService.js like:-
      I.E.:- var firebaseObj = new Firebase("https://practical-app-dbdf2.firebaseio.com/practical");

  =>  $firebaseArray service takes a firebase reference and returns array which contains data provided by firebase reference
      I.E.:- return this.fb = $firebaseArray(firebaseObj);

Now, we have a form.html and form.js and we want to Get,Add,Delete the data from form.html to firebase. 
  =>  getFirebaseObj function in firebaseService returns firebase reference in form.js 
      I.E.:- var fb = firebaseService.getFirebaseObj();

Add,Get,Delete
=>we have a form.js
  $scope.addEmployee = function() {
    var employee = $scope.emp; 
    var empData = {
        'name' : employee.name,
        'age' : employee.age,
        'password' : employee.password,
        'email' : employee.email,
        'message' : employee.message
    };

  =>  For Add the data to the Firebase.
  =>  $add method of $firebaseArray service takes array/object as a parameter and returns a promise which is resolved when data has been saved 	     into firebase DB 
      I.E.:-  fb.$add(empData).then(function(ref) {
                $scope.emp = {};
                alert("Employee data successfully saved.");
              });

  =>  For Getting the data from the Firebase.
  =>  $loaded method return a promise which is resolved when the data has been downloaded from the firebase DB
      I.E.:-  fb.$loaded().then(function(x) {
                  $scope.employeeData = x;
                if ($scope.employeeData.length !== 0) {
                      $scope.showEmpData = true;
                  }
              });

  =>  For Delete the data from the Firebase.
  =>  $remove method return a promise which is resolved when the data has been deleted from the DB
      I.E.:-  $scope.removeData = function(user) {
                fb.$remove(user).then(function(ref) {
                    if (ref.key() === user.$id) {
                        alert("record successfully deleted.");
                    } 
                });
